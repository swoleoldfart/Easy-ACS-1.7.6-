# Easy-ACS-1.7.6-
ACS already installed, just add onto it.
Basic ACS Starterpack 

-Comes with MopMed
-Comes with 1.7.6 ACS (Canucks)

(NOT MADE BY ME , I JUST MADE IT INTO A REPO AND ADDED A FEW THINGS TO MAKE IT EASY)

How to install guns:
-Search up ACS Guns in toolbox, MAKE SURE THEY ARE THE CORRECT VERSION (1.7.6.). After this you need to search up "GunModels" in Explorer (If you dont have this go to view and select it). You are then going to drag the "Client" (DO THE SAME FOR SERVER). Once you do this, drag the tool into "Starterpack" or somewhere else if you would like.
